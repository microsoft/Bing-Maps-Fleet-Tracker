  <p>Create a device by clicking on the + button. Download the Android apk or set up iOS mobile client on your
    phone. Open the mobile application from your phone and scan the QR code to finish provisioning the device.
    Alternatively, if you will be using your own background tracking client, dismiss the popup and give your
    device a unique ID and a unique name. You can find the Linked Asset property and select the asset to 
    link it with the device. Click submit once you are done. You can still click on the edit (pencil icon) 
    button on each device to make modification after your submission.  </p>
