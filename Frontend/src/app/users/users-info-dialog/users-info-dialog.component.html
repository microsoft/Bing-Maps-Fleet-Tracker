<p>On a fresh deployment, only the owner can access the portal. If another user tries to sign in to the portal, they will be marked as "pending" and blocked from accessing resources, until an administrator grants them access.

  <ul>
    <li>
        Blocked: User will not be able to access the portal 
  
    </li>
    <li>
      Pending: User will not be able to access the portal until an administrator grants him access 
    </li>
    <li>
      Viewer: User will be able to view assets, devices, and reports but will not be able to edit anything 
    </li>
    <li>
      Administrator: User will have full access to the portal's features     
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
