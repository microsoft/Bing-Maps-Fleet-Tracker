    <p>
        If you wish to be alerted when a specific group of assets enters or exits an area, you can use the geofence feature. You define a geofence as a polygon surrounding an area. Triggered geofences have a cooldown (in minutes) which controls how much time must at least pass before it gets triggered again. Inbound geofences trigger when an asset that was outside the geofenced area enters it. Outbound geofences trigger when an asset that was inside the geofenced area leaves it.
